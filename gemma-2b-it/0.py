    **Test cases:**
    ```python
    import unittest
    
    class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    
        def test_has_close_elements(self):
            self.assertEqual(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5), False)
            self.assertEqual(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3), True)
            self.assertEqual(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 1.0), False)
            self.assertEqual(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.0), False)
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
    ```
    
    **Explanation:**
    * The `has_close_elements` function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input.
    * It iterates over the list and compares each element with every other element in the list.
    * If the distance between two elements is less than the threshold, it returns True.
    * If the loop completes without finding any elements that are close enough to each other, it returns False.
    
    **Note:**
    * The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the list. This is because the function iterates over the list twice, once to find all the pairs of elements and once to check if they are close enough to each other.
    * The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), as it only requires a constant amount of memory to store the list of numbers.
