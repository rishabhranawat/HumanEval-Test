def solution():
    ```
    The given code is a Python program that tests the `even_odd_palindrome` function. 
    
    **Test cases:**
    1. Input: 3
       Output: (1, 2)
    2. Input: 12
       Output: (4, 6)
    3. Input: 1
       Output: (1, 1)
    4. Input: 10
       Output: (0, 0)
    5. Input: 11
       Output: (1, 1)
    
    **Explanation:**
    The `even_odd_palindrome` function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a tuple containing the number of even and odd integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.
    
    * An integer palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward, like 1212.
    * The function first initializes two variables, `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count`, to 0. These variables will keep track of the number of even and odd integer palindromes, respectively.
    * It then iterates through all the numbers from 1 to `n` using a for loop.
    * For each number `i`, it checks if `i` is odd and a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function. If `i` is odd and a palindrome, it increments the `odd_palindrome_count`.
    * If `i` is even and a palindrome, it increments the `even_palindrome_count`.
    * After the loop has finished, the function returns the tuple containing the values of `even_palindrome_count` and `odd_palindrome_count`.
    
    **Note:**
    The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the input integer. This is because the function iterates through all the numbers in the range(1, n) and checks if each number is a palindrome.
