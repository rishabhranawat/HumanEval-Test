def solution():
    ```
    This code defines a function called `move_one_ball` that takes an array of integers `arr` as input and returns True if it's possible to sort the array using the given operation, and False otherwise. 
    
    The code first checks if the array is empty and returns True if it is. 
    If the array is not empty, it sorts the array using the `sorted` function and stores the sorted array in the `sorted_array` variable. 
    
    Then, it initializes a new empty list called `my_arr` and adds the elements of the original array to `my_arr` in the order they appear in the array. 
    
    The code then finds the minimum value in the array and stores it in the `min_value` variable. 
    
    The code also finds the index of the minimum value in the `min_index` variable. 
    
    Finally, the code iterates through the `my_arr` list and checks if each element is equal to the corresponding element in the `sorted_array`. If any element is not equal, it returns False. 
    
    If the code successfully completes the iteration without finding any elements that don't match, it returns True, indicating that it's possible to sort the array using the given operation.
