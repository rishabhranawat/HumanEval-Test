    ```python
    import unittest
    
    class TestGreatestCommonDivisor(unittest.TestCase):
    
        def test_valid_inputs(self):
            self.assertEqual(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5), 1)
            self.assertEqual(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15), 5)
    
        def test_invalid_inputs(self):
            self.assertEqual(greatest_common_divisor(0, 0), 0)
            self.assertEqual(greatest_common_divisor(1, 0), 1)
            self.assertEqual(greatest_common_divisor(0, 1), 0)
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
    ```
    
    **Explanation:**
    
    * The `greatest_common_divisor` function takes two integers as input and returns their greatest common divisor.
    * The function uses a greedy approach to find the greatest common divisor.
    * The function first initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, to the input values.
    * Then, it repeatedly divides `a` by `b` and updates `a` and `b` to the remainder and the quotient, respectively.
    * The function continues this process until `b` is 0, which means that `a` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
    * Finally, the function returns the value of `a`.
    
    **Note:**
    
    * The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log(min(a, b))), where `min(a, b)` is the smaller of the two numbers.
    * The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1), as it only requires a constant amount of memory to store the two variables `a` and `b`.
