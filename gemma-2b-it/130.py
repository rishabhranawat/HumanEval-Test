            if i % 2 == 0:
                my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2])
            # If the index is odd, add the three previous numbers to the Tribonacci sequence
            else:
                my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)

    ```
    This code defines a function called `tri` that takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    
    The Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    
    ```
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    ```
    
    The code uses a base case to handle the base case of the Tribonacci sequence, which is when `n` is 0. In this case, it returns a list containing only the first number of the Tribonacci sequence, which is 1.
    
    The code then iterates through the rest of the numbers in the Tribonacci sequence and calculates the next number in the sequence by adding the two middle numbers to the previous number if the index is even, or by adding the three previous numbers to the previous number if the index is odd.
    
    Finally, the code returns the Tribonacci sequence, which is a list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
