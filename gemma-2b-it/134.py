    **Test cases:**
     
    ```python
    def test_check_if_last_char_is_a_letter():
        assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") is False
        assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") is True
        assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ") is False
        assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") is False
        assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("a") is True
        assert check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("z") is True
    ```
    
    **Explanation:**
     
    * The `check` variable is split by the space character into a list of words.
    * The last element of the list is the last character of the string.
    * The function checks if the length of the `check` is 1 and if the last character is an alphabetical character between 'a' and 'z'.
    * If both conditions are met, it returns `True`.
    * Otherwise, it returns `False`.
