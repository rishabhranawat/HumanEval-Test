    **Explanation:**
    
    * The `digits_sum` function takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of its digits. It handles negative numbers by considering the sign and converting them to positive before calculating the sum.
    * The `order_by_points` function takes a list of integers `nums` as input and sorts them based on the `digits_sum` function. It uses the `sorted` function with a custom key function that calls the `digits_sum` function for each element in the list.
    * The `test_order_by_points` function contains a suite of tests that cover different edge cases and expected output. It ensures that the `order_by_points` function works as intended.
    
    **Output:**
    
    The output of running the test suite will be:
