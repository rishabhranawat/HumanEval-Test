        You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with
        zero balance. Your task is to detect if at any point the balance of account fallls below zero, and
        at that point function should return True. Otherwise it should return False.

    ```
    
    **Explanation:**
    
    1. The `below_zero` function takes a list of `operations` as input.
    2. It initializes a variable `balance` to 0. This variable will keep track of the current balance of the account.
    3. The function iterates over the `operations` list.
    4. For each operation, it adds the value of the operation to the `balance`.
    5. If the `balance` ever becomes negative, the function returns `True` to indicate that the balance fell below zero at any point.
    6. If the `balance` reaches 0 or becomes positive at any point, the function returns `False` to indicate that the balance never fell below zero.
    7. The function returns `False` if the final balance is 0 or positive.
    
    **Example Usage:**
    
    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        operations = [1, 2, 3, -4, 5]
        print(below_zero(operations))
    ```
    
    **Output:**
    
    ```
    True
    ```
