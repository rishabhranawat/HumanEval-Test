        return l
    ```
    
    **Explanation:**
    
    1. The `sort_third` function takes a list `l` as input.
    2. It initializes a new list `l` with the same elements as the input list `l`.
    3. It uses slicing with the step value `3` to create a copy of the input list `l` with elements at even indices removed. This creates a list `l` that contains all the elements of the input list except those at indices divisible by 3.
    4. The `sorted` function is called on the copy of the input list `l[::3]`. This sorts the elements in this sublist in ascending order.
    5. The sorted sublist is then assigned to the `l[::3]` slice of the original list `l`. This ensures that the elements in the original list at odd indices are preserved in the correct order.
    6. Finally, the function returns the sorted list `l`.
    
    **Example Usage:**
    
    ```python
    print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))
    print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
    ```
    
    **Output:**
    
    ```
    [1, 2, 3]
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    ```
