    **Test cases:**
    ```python
    import unittest
    
    class TestFizzBuzz(unittest.TestCase):
    
        def test_fizz_buzz_0(self):
            self.assertEqual(fizz_buzz(50), 0)
    
        def test_fizz_buzz_78(self):
            self.assertEqual(fizz_buzz(78), 2)
    
        def test_fizz_buzz_79(self):
            self.assertEqual(fizz_buzz(79), 3)
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
    ```
    
    **Explanation:**
    
    * The `fizz_buzz` function takes an integer `n` as input.
    * It initializes a list `ns` to store the numbers to check.
    * It iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n`.
    * For each number, it checks if it is divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulo operator (`%`). If it is divisible, it is appended to the `ns` list.
    * It converts the `ns` list to a string and concatenates the numbers with '7' in the correct positions.
    * It initializes a variable `ans` to 0.
    * It iterates through the string and adds 1 to `ans` if the current character is '7'.
    * Finally, it returns the value of `ans`.
    
    **Note:**
    
    * The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the input integer.
    * The algorithm assumes that the input integer is an integer. If it is not, the function will return an error.
