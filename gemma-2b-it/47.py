    This test suite covers the following scenarios:
    
    * A list with an even number of elements.
    * A list with an odd number of elements.
    * A list with only one element.
    * An empty list.
    * A list with only one element.
    * A list with a single element.
    * A list with a list of elements.
    * A list with a list of elements.
    
    The test suite uses the `assert` statement to verify that the median function is working correctly.
