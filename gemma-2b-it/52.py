    **Explanation:**
    
    * The `below_threshold` function takes two arguments: the list of numbers `l` and the threshold value `t`.
    * It uses a `for` loop to iterate through the list.
    * Inside the loop, it checks if the current number `e` is greater than or equal to the threshold value `t`.
    * If `e` is greater than or equal to `t`, it returns `False` to indicate that at least one number in the list is greater than or equal to the threshold.
    * If all numbers in the list are below the threshold, it returns `True` after the loop completes.
    * The function uses `return True` to indicate that all numbers in the list are below the threshold.
    
    **Note:**
    
    * The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the list. This is because the function iterates through the list once to check if all numbers are below the threshold.
