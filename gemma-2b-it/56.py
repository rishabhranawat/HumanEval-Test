    **Test cases:**
    
    ```python
    import unittest
    
    class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    
        def test_correct_bracketing(self):
            self.assertEqual(correct_bracketing("<"), False)
            self.assertEqual(correct_bracketing("<>"), True)
            self.assertEqual(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"), True)
            self.assertEqual(correct_bracketing("><<>"), False)
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        unittest.main()
    ```
    
    **Explanation:**
    
    * The `correct_bracketing` function takes a string of brackets as input.
    * It initializes a variable `depth` to 0. This variable keeps track of the depth of the current bracket in the string.
    * The function iterates over the string and adds 1 to `depth` whenever it encounters an opening bracket `"<"` and subtracts 1 from `depth` whenever it encounters a closing bracket `">"`.
    * If the `depth` ever becomes negative, it means that there is a bracket that is not paired with a matching closing bracket. Therefore, the function returns `False`.
    * If the `depth` reaches 0 after the traversal, it means that all opening and closing brackets have been paired correctly, and the string is valid. Therefore, the function returns `True`.
    
    **Note:**
    
    * The function assumes that the input string only contains opening and closing brackets. It does not handle other types of characters, such as numbers or letters.
