        """Return True is list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.
    
        Args:
            l (list): The list to check.
    
        Returns:
            bool: True if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing, False otherwise.
        """
    
        # Sort the list in ascending order.
        l.sort()
    
        # If the list is already sorted in ascending order, then it is monotonically increasing.
        if l == sorted(l):
            return True
    
        # If the list is sorted in descending order, then it is monotonically decreasing.
        elif l == sorted(l, reverse=True):
            return True
    
        # Otherwise, the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing.
        else:
            return False
    ```
    
    **Example Usage:**
    
    ```python
    print(monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20]))  # True
    print(monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10]))  # False
    print(monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10]))  # True
    ```
    
    **Explanation:**
    
    * The `monotonic` function takes a list `l` as input.
    * It first sorts the list in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
    * If the list is already sorted in ascending order, it is monotonically increasing.
    * If the list is sorted in descending order, it is monotonically decreasing.
    * If the list is not sorted, it is monotonically increasing or decreasing.
    * The function returns `True` if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing, and `False` otherwise.

# You can add tests or other function calls here.
