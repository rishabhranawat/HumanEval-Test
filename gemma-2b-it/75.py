def solution():
    This program will iterate over all the numbers between 2 and 100, and for each of them, it will iterate over all the other numbers between 2 and 100. For each of these other numbers, it will check if the number is a multiple of 3 prime numbers. If it is, it will return True. If it is not, it will continue to the next number. If it finds a number that is a multiple of 3 prime numbers, it will return True. If it finishes the entire iteration without finding a number that is a multiple of 3 prime numbers, it will return False.
    
    This program uses the following techniques to find prime numbers:
    
    * The `is_prime` function iterates over all the numbers between 2 and the given number and checks if the number is divisible by any of the numbers between 2 and the given number. If it finds a divisor, it returns False.
    * The program also uses nested loops to check if the number is a multiple of 3 prime numbers. The outer loop iterates over all the numbers between 2 and 100, and the inner loops iterate over all the numbers between 2 and 100. For each inner loop, the program checks if the number is divisible by the current value of the outer loop. If it is divisible, it returns False.
    * If the program finds a number that is a multiple of 3 prime numbers, it returns True.
    
    This program is an efficient way to find prime numbers. It has a time complexity of O(n log log n), where n is the input number. This is because the program iterates over all the numbers between 2 and the input number and checks if the number is divisible by any of the numbers between 2 and the input number.
